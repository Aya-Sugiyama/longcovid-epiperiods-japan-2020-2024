"Values are presented as point estimates of the survival function S(t) with 95% confidence intervals in parentheses. Estimates were obtained from interval-censored survival analysis using the Turnbull method, with step-function–based alignment of survival curves at common time points. Values of 0 (0–0) indicate that all participants had recovered and no variation was observed, resulting in a zero standard error.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
